# music

this imaginitively named library contains a collection of tools for algorithmic music. I use them with overtone, but they aren't framework specific. The main parts are:

pitch.clj - a fairly comprehensive collection of tools for manipulating pitchs, keys, scales, chords and melodies. Most of this is ported from andrew sorensen's amazing pc-ivl.scm library.

utils.clj - a basic set of tools for generating melodys/rhythm using state machines and lazy event sequences.
